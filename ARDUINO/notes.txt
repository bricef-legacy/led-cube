NOTES
=====

Could we find a way to interrupt only when we are writing to the arduino using the USB cable?
Is the USB cable on the TWI (Twin Wire Interface) or the SPI (Serial Peripheral interface)?
The TWI comes with a handy interrupt that we could use. This would allow us to draw as quickly as possible.
