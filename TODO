(brice) remove debug markers and variables in ARDUINO/array_receive/array_receive.pde
(brice) test serial code on NIX
(Ed) process a bytestream onto the LED cube [Done Codeing, Needs testing on wed. (added to brices Prog)]
(Sam) create a state array to bytestream converter
(Mike) Create a processing class for a 3D Ising model


Unassigned
----------
maybe? Implement arbitrary sketch loading via gui to allow end user to write own display loop using api 
Test gui and serial exec on MAC
Modify gui to use the CLIENT sketches for communication with arduino
	-> port selection using Serial.list() from processing.serial
Modify gui to incorporate image load/save from file
Cleanup API making sense of x,y,z when building cube state array
Code review + cleanup
Build cube
create a wrapper class with toggles around simCube and realCube
Test liveupdate speed vs simualtion speed. 
create a gui element to toggle live update
Write the readme

DONE:
=====
(Ed) Use an image file to store the states.
(Sam) finish Gui
