Unassigned
----------
maybe? Implement arbitrary sketch loading via gui to allow end user to write own display loop using api 
Test gui and serial exec on MAC
gui port selection using Serial.list() from processing.serial
Cleanup API making sense of x,y,z when building cube state array
Write the readme
integrate audio analysis app
test driver integration

DONE:
=====
(Mike) Create a processing class for a 3D Ising model
(Sam) create a state array to bytestream converter
(Ed) process a bytestream onto the LED cube [Done Codeing, Needs testing on wed. (added to brices Prog)]
(brice) remove debug markers and variables in ARDUINO/array_receive/array_receive.pde
(brice) test serial code on NIX
(Ed) Use an image file to store the states.
